    "The data is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset, downloaded as csv files and uploaded to my own Postgres database. Whilst csv files could be directly accessed and manipulated via Python (Pandas), I wanted to gain experience managing and querying data in a database. The data set was up to date as of 2020, and so this analysis is a reflection of the data at that time.\n",

    "Whilst the full data set contains all movies listed on IMDb, my queries will more than likely only consist of movies where English is a listed language and where there are more than 5000 recorded votes. I understand there is some bias to these restrictions, but my reasoning is as follows. To the former point, I am an English speaker and am primarily interested in English spoken movies. This is not always the case, but upon querying the database there were far too many non-English spoken films, and this did not benefit me in my aims for this analysis. To the latter point, movie ratings were heavily skewed by a lack of votes. The average vote count across all movies was just over 9000. I understand that newer movies are heavily discriminated by using this metric, but it was more beneficial overall. I settled on including all movies that had at least 5000 votes."
